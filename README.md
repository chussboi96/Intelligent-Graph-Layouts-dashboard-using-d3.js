The webpage allows users to upload a csv that contains an adjacency matrix, then our dashboard intelligently analyzes the graph to identify its characteristics and classifying it as either a General Graph, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), or a Tree. Based on this classification, it offers layout options that best represent the graph's structure.
